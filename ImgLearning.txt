1. maps
// arr = [10, 10, 20, 30];

// arr.map((x, index) => {
//   console.log(x + index);
// });

2.
        return <RestaurantCard {...rr.info} key = {...rr.info.id} />; 
we have used destructuring to destructure the res object  and given unique key to every component 

and passed as props 

const RestaurantCard = ({
  cloudinaryImageId,
  aggregatedDiscountInfoV3,
  sla,
  name,
  avgRatingString,
  costForTwo,
  cuisines,
})

3. there are two way for exporting the file from component 
    -   export default Title
    - for importing 
    import Header from "./components/Header";
                                    /Header.js
                                    /Header.jsx
    any thing is fine 
    We can export default only one thing 
    
    2nd type is exporting the Named import
 
        - incase of title 
        import {Title} from "./components/Title";
        export const Title =(){}



	here in title {not destructuring}
	
	when its named import then we can importt as {title , header} from “path”



- We need to create a config file  , in which all the hard coded data are put 

and this will be a named import
